## Building

PgBouncer depends on few things to get compiled:

* `GNU Make`_ 3.81+
* libevent_ 2.0
* (optional) OpenSSL_ 1.0.1 for TLS support.
* (optional) `c-ares`_ as alternative to libevent's evdns.

.. _GNU Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
.. _libevent: http://libevent.org/
.. _OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/
.. _`c-ares`: http://c-ares.haxx.se/

When dependencies are installed just run::

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libevent=libevent-prefix
    $ make
    $ make install

## Building for OSX

./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2q/
